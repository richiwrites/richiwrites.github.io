        <h3><b>Super Mom</b></h3>
      <h5>Mother <span class="w3-opacity">May 6,2020</span></h5>
        <p><b>richi.writes</b>
I am the only child of my working parents. My father lives in Mymensingh who visits twice a month and here I live with Ma and a nanny who has been there since I was 3 months old. Today I'm here to write about being the only child of a working mom.<br><br>
Ma has been a working lady forever.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> I have always been proud of her but being her child was HARD. She used to part from me very early in the morning while leaving for office. But after she came back, I jumped into my momma bear and didn't let go for the rest of the night. Ma used to travel a lot due to official works in and out of the country. I was a good kid so she had it easy to work because I never really cried or nagged when she left. I probably understood that wherever she goes, she's coming back with a lot of chocolates so yeah. Ma couldn't attend some of my school programmes and I understood it is what it is.<br><br>
Sometimes I used to be jealous of the children who got picked up from school by their moms. But I learnt how hard it is for working moms. How sad Ma must have felt when she had to leave my sleepy cute(st) face alone in the morning. How she struggled through work worrying about me all day. I think I was an extra workload for her but she believes I am
her pride and her happiness and I think it is only possible for a mother to revolve her whole life around the little human she birthed. Ma loves her work but her first priority is being a MOTHER. She says motherhood has only made her life better despite raising, as she says, "a sagol". Ma always had it very challenging because my father has his job elsewhere and managing everything alone is exhausting. Being the child of a such a supermom can only term me as the luckiest living entity. During this quarantine, I'm getting to live with her all day which is rare as you can tell. And though she is doing <b>#wfh</b> and is always on meetings, we still gossip a lot while sipping our teas and ma is SUCH A GOSSIP PARTNER. I would say being the child of working parents is HARD and I'm sure others with working parents will relate. But I wouldn't have it any other way. Being the baby of this bosslady is always worth it.</span></p>

        <p><b>richi.writes</b>
"Tujhe sab hai pata hai na maa<br>
Tujhe sab hai pata meri maa"<br><br>
Remember when we couldn't walk? Remember who held our fingers and clapped the loudest even when we failed at multiple attempts at walking? When we learnt to walk,<span id="a">...</span><span id="b">  remember whose extended hands were waiting for us at the endline? Remember the first word that escaped our  mouth? Ma.<br><br>
Ma used to play hide and seek and when her face unfolded from behind the curtain, remember our toothless smiles? We had the trust that ma is there, Ma will always be there. Remember when we used to vomit on Ma, pull her hair, jump on her aching body, pee or shit our pants, cry because we were hungry at 3 am (good time to crave food) just to give Ma all the extra works after all the exhaustions she already had? And Ma completed the chores and lay beside us and we peacefully slept hiding our face into her chest. We don't remember those days but one thing we know for sure is Ma was the only world we knew.<br><br>
And now we're all grown-ups and very much effficient in walking, talking, eating all by ourselves. Ma is annoying (she tells us to study), Ma is typical, Ma is "backdated" cause she doesn't know how instagram works, Ma annoys. But we all know who will forgive us for all the mistakes we make even when the whole world decides to stand on the other side. We all know which ONE human being will love us unconditionally even when we're big failures. Yes, you got that right. Our typical Ma.<br><br>

Ma. Who loves us with the heart using Z E R O brain logics cause brain doesn't speak unconditional love. I'm lucky my Ma is here. And some mothers are watching their beloved kids from up above, showering love. Ma will cook biryani for me, Ma will know when I have pet betha, Ma will stay up all night to magically cure the fever I get. Ma's don't take leaves from motherhood job.<br><br>
And yes, Ma nags all day about why I don't study, Ma says she won't let me enter "her" home if I'm late from outings, Ma scolds. But you know what. While watching bollywood movies together and translating the difficult hindi words to Ma, I will always wonder if I can ever love someone, something more than this woman. Happy mother's day, supermoms.</span></p>

        <h3><b>Female Friendship</b></h3>
      <h5>Forever <span class="w3-opacity">May 8,2020</span></h5>
        <p><b>richi.writes</b>
How exactly are female friendships different than male friendships? Glad you asked. I think there's a huge difference. I mean, the kind of sentimental attachment boys share with boys and girls with girls is different. Not the friendship, no. The real essence of friendship is the same. It's just the ways that are variant.<br><br>

As the saying goes, female friends are jealous, bitchy and have competitive and scheming minds. Well, I have my bunch of female friends who  <span id="r">...</span><span id="s">are breaking stereotypes and are always extra supportive, extra loving and extra encouraging when it comes to friendship (a lil bit of bitchy also). My female friends boost up my confidence. My female friends know me inside out, my darkest secrets, all my embarrassing moments, they also have lived those moments with me. Ranting sessions with my female friends might not solve problems but give the sense of relief, reassurance and less emotional burden to carry.<br><br>

My female friendships were formed during stalking senior crushes, breakup turmoils, senti talks, lending shoulders to cry on and luckily, my female friends are there to give me that touch, that hug, that shoulder to lean on. My female friends understand my feminine problems, how my brain exactly works and they understand and relate to the emotions running inside me which males may laugh off while putting them in the invalid category.<br><br>

You say we are jealous and competitive but we keep our own problems aside and deal with our friends first. My female friendships are gracefully flying putting down the complexities of life and the changes of adulthood. My female friends will celebrate my littlest victory even when they are going through the hardest time themselves. My female friends will encourage me even if they are not really acing their own life. The beauty, the comfort, the familiar homely vibe I find in my female friends are enough to lift me up everyday. My female friends are my home. And I want them to stick to me while growing up, getting married, having kids, having work-life and getting old. And here's what I want to say to all my babygirls : Life's less hard with you guys in it.</span></p>

       <h3><b>Self Love</b></h3>
      <h5>Inspirations <span class="w3-opacity">May 12,2020</span></h5>
        <p>
<b>richi.writes</b>
Let's be honest. We all are willing to be perfect in everything we aspire to achieve. While we work hard to succeed, we are often labeled as 'failures'. I fail a lot. I fail more than I achieve. Things get hard more often than I admit. And while all my contemporaries are acing whatever they are doing, the picture perfect life of people on social media give me the twinging bit of inferiority complex and let's face it, even a bit of jealousy. I was combatting the I-am-not-good-enough phase of mine because I was cluelessly floating with my life while my friends had their life figured out (I thought) and it's hard feeling happy for successful contemporaries and sad for <span id="x">...</span><span id="y"> my own dumb self.<br><br>

I saw people living my dreams while I'm failing my constant endeavors. I felt everyone is doing everything better than me and I can never reach that level. I felt an influx of pressure from within myself to constantly push my boundaries and do better, try harder and finally be  ENOUGH.<br><br>
It took me some time to realize that the case is actually very different. I heard the anecdotes of failures of my friends who I thought had the picture perfect life free of problems and insecurities. But they too had stories. The filtered life isn't the whole story. They too failed. When I realized that noone has achieved anything without constant struggle, that one realization changed a lot in me. I started to be more considerate and kind to others and mostly to myself.<br><br>
I understood that it's not always necessary to be better. The pursuing of creativity is hard and a lifelong process where I can't claim to be the best. I have to appreciate the people better than me in the field and do my best while I am at it. Success to me is no longer the highest peak rather it's what gives me mental peace of finally creating something. Creativity is my success.
I am a very simple 17 y/o who wakes up happy, has the best of friends and knows that there are demons hiding under everyone's bed. So I let go of the series of self questioning, accepted my low days and I'm standing strong because my littlest achievements are good enough reasons to make me feel I am so much more than just ENOUGH.</span></p>
