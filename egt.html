        <p><b>richi.writes</b><br>
Dear future lover,<br>
They say 90s was the last romantic generation<br>
They say our generation doesn't know love<br>
They say love lost its meaning in the twentieth century<br>
But little do they<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> know, my love,<br>
That love sure as hell changed its meaning but never lost it.<br>
You don't have to write me long handwritten letters<br>
One cheesy text from you on a busy day will make me smile<br>
Or email me long paragraphs when I'm mad :(<br>
I'm glad I don't have to wait months to meet you secretly for 10 minutes like the 90s<br>
I'll video call you anytime just to stare at that beautiful receeding hairline.<br>
It's okay if we don't go to theatres to watch movies like the 90s<br>
Someday we'll cuddle under a blanket and fall asleep watching a cheesy romcom. Count some popcorns too.<br><br>

Heard 90s people would wait months to meet each other<br>
It's actually pretty great that I can slide into your dms or send you voice notes explaining my day in details.<br>
I realize things are no longer as dramatic as 90s<br>
But we'll still bunk coachings to meet, right? Talk about RoMaNcE.<br>
Our parents say they used to collect information about each other from mutual friends<br>
See, I'll just click on 'view all comments' or probably like a two year old post of yours while stalking.<br>
It's okay if you don't sing cheesy songs for me like 90s though I'd like them too<br>
Send me a song that reminded you of me.<br>
90s had its evening badmintons,<br>
We'll have among us and task-date ;)<br>
Just like our parents have their memories safe in old albums,<br>
I'll show our kids my story archives.<br>
Unlike the black and white studio clicked pictures of 90s,<br>
Let's click cute pictures with those cute bear filters on Instagram.<br>
They say romance lies in handwritten letters, dried up roses and shy conversations of 90s<br>
I say romance lies in our apology emails, after-school fuchka or late night phone calls.<br>
So see,<br>
We might not love like them<br>
But we'll love like us<br>
And those who say our generation doesn't know love<br>
Here we are blushing at cute texts from each other,<br>
Crying our eyes out over broken hearts,<br>
Falling and learning, growing with each other<br>
Here we are.<br>
Falling in love in the twenty first century,<br>
Scrolling, typing swiping and promising each other a lifetime.</span></p>

      <h5>End <span class="w3-opacity">December 27,2020</span></h5>
        <p><b>richi.writes</b>
My Instagram story archives showing me how happy and excited I was just a year ago is actually deeply saddening. And here, let's face it, 2020 ends in 3 days. And let's just say in unison- What. A. Year. The more I write about 2020, the less it seems. The scariest roller coaster would be way easier than going past this year.<br><br>

"2020 is ending. What have you achieved?"<span id="a">...</span><span id="b"> I have seen this question on a post and saw someone saying "this is really not the year for that question" and boy do I agree. The whole world has come to a standstill. A board exam got cancelled, everyone got locked within four walls, people lost their closest ones, zoom made its place in our daily routines and let's just say there's so much a human brain can cope with.<br><br>

I have lost so much this year. Witnessed death real close. And there's no explanation how much of despair death brings to the ones still surviving. It would be safe to say this has been the worst year in my entire lifetime. But at the end of the day, if this year has taught the world one emotion, that would be gratefulness. While the survivor's guilt is still pretty evident, we are grateful to be still breathing. We are grateful Covid looked past us on its way. I do commend myself for just living through this year. I commend every single person for keeping sanity till date. The world is crumbling down and we are still waking up, flipping our laptop open for 7 am classes, doing homeworks, studying for tests, baking, cooking, sleeping, binge watching and discovering coping mechanisms that we didn't know would work as coping mechanisms.<br><br>

You know what. We survived. Let's just give ourselves some credit for just that. For just being alive till the end. We still witnessed red noses, foggy glasses, sunshine, chocolate cakes, millions cups of teas, taking zoom screenshots of friends, video calls on functions and creating a whole vast world through screens. A global pandemic happened, the world stopped. At the end, let's say this together, hand in hand, we are alive and that's such a beautiful thing.</span></p>

        <p><b>richi.writes</b>
Dear 2020,<br>
So here we are, huh? The end of you. Wrapping you up into a limited Instagram caption won't be easy at all. You have snatched a lot, 2020. You have taken away the most important thing a human can hold on to. You have taken our hope away. You have pushed the world to a point where the human race had their back against a wall and we waited, hopelessly. We didn't even know what you kept in store for us. But let me tell you this, darling. You have tried<span id="r">...</span><span id="s"> to kill, we have fought to live. And guess what. We won.<br><br>

You haven't left much room for appreciation actually. Everyday we woke up to horrible news, each day worse than the other. But you know what. Enough of hating you, 2020. I'll let you leave in peace. With a heavy heart, I forgive you. I forgive you for being cruel, I feel pity for the hatred we threw towards you as a coping mechanism to survive. I forgive you for not making sense. I forgive you for stealing the last year of my college.<br><br>

I do thank you, though. Through grief, we learnt. Wasn't an easy learning process but we still learnt. Only when death looked us in the eye did we realize the beauty of life. There were milestones we set for ourselves, goals we wanted to reach. We began 2020 with dreams of endless possibilities. And even though all we did was sleep with zoom classes on, I do thank you. For the little good things. For this account I opened as an impulsive decision. For still providing me with a privilege of a set of parents, a roof over my head and square meals thrice a day.<br><br>

2020, we won't forget you. We never will. What a tale to tell our kids. We will remember you for every single thing you've taken away and every little thing you've given us. I assure you we won't revisit you ever again. We won't romanticise you. We will just let you go. With a heavy heart, a tiny smile too probably. And here it ends, with no resolution, no goals set, just taking it one day at a time.<br><br>

Wherever you go, 2020, take with you the grief you brought.<br>
Farewell,<br>
A sad, ill world.</span></p>

<b>richi.writes</b>
Dear 2021,<br>
We welcome you with wide, warm, sanitised hands. As messed up as the world is right now, we cannot promise you a happy welcome. But we opted for a colorful sky last night with sky lanterns and beautiful fireworks to make your entrance a bit beautiful amidst the catastrophe we are in. We can't promise you hopeful minds and dreamy eyes this time, but we assure you we are stepping foot on you with much<span id="x">...</span><span id="y"> stronger, much more resilient and kinder minds. After the shitshow we've gone through, we await for you to be the sunshine.<br><br>

2021, us humans are amazing, I tell you. Our hearts look for hope in places our brains declared hopelessness. So in case you're wondering, yes, we still carry hope. Crossed fingers, nervous minds and silent prayers for you to magically cure the world. While entering 2020, we were fragile dreamy humans. But this time, we are transformed into such strong beings who have experienced loss, have fought for survival with hearts crushed like glasses. And I tell you, this time, we are ready. Human race will amaze you once again.<br><br>

We have learnt fighting, 2021. So you better watch your steps. We have relearnt old lessons, broke ourselves and re-moulded into newer entities. This time, we enter you with hands held strongly, with unity in mind, with shared grief and standing tall beside each other. We are not scared this time. We do realize that pre-covid world is firmly history now and we can never be our old selves again. But what we want from you is a post-covid world. When we throw our masks away like graduation caps and breathe the fresh air together. A world where laughs will be genuine again and life will feel okay.<br><br>

2021, come to us as the light at the end of the tunnel. Come to us as a warm blanket on the coldest night. Come to us with promises of possibilities. We welcome you with pretty skies and shining eyes and last sips of teas. Come, make this world safe again. Come, we are waiting for you, love.<br>
Welcome,<br>
A ill, hopeful world</span></p>
