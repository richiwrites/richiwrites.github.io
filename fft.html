        <h3><b>Bully</b></h3>
      <h5>Stop <span class="w3-opacity">July 9,2020</span></h5>
        <p><b>richi.writes</b><br>
My parents wondered why I hated going to school<br>
That's because I was bullied for not being "beautiful"<br>
I had an "ugly" skin tone, a darker shade of brown<br>
I was told I'm "dirty" and I was treated like a clown<br>
People laughed at me and the boy I liked never liked<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> me back<br>
And this way I grew up focusing on only what I "lack"<br>
I lathered my skin with fairness creams and I got those acnes and rash<br>
I didn't care because I wanted to be treated as something more than "trash"<br>
And till date, I never dare to go out without makeup on my face<br>
School still haunts me and it was supposed to be my "safe" place.<br><br>


I was bullied at school because I was "fat"<br>
I will never ever forget the way I was laughed at<br>
I was poked with pencils and was called the ugliest names<br>
Tell me honestly, was my overweight really my matter of shame?<br>
Not only the students, the teachers too called me "the fat kid"<br>
Teachers who taught me humanity in class themselves forgot about it<br>
I too wished I had friends with who I could sit, laugh and talk<br>
But I knew I was "fat", an object only to be mocked<br>
Trust me tried my best to jerk off my shame, I ate less to not at all<br>
And till date I wish "fat" wasn't the only name I was called.<br><br>


I was bullied online no matter what dress I wore<br>
I could never be pretty, all I was called were "slut" or "whore"<br>
Random people commenting on my pictures saying they wish I died<br>
But it hurt so much some nights, I remember how hard I cried<br>
They caused my clinical depression and I was tired of fighting beasts<br>
But I forgave them the moment I put the blade on my wrist.<br><br>


Dear parents, don't tell your sons crying makes them weak<br>
Hug them tight and listen to them while they speak<br>
Teach your children to always value the people around them<br>
Tell them if someone is being bad, they're not the ones to blame<br>
Teach your children to respect, love and care<br>
And tell your kids the words they still need to hear<br>
"It's normal to be bullied on social media, comeon get in the line"<br>
CYBER BULLYING IS NOT NORMAL, STOP SPREADING HATE ONLINE<br>
I hope the children grow up being taught love instead of hate<br>
Because school is supposed to be a "second home" for kids, not a place they dread.</span></p>

      <h5>Memories <span class="w3-opacity">July 14,2020</span></h5>
        <p><b>richi.writes</b><br>
Lying under the night sky, I see a shooting star, you know<br><br>

I wonder if some other star cried while letting this star go<br><br>

I wonder if stars on the sky fall in <span id="a">...</span><span id="b">love too<br><br>

I wonder if they love like me and leave like you<br><br>

I still remember your presence smelled something like hope<br><br>

I still remember your presence felt something like home<br><br>

In your presence, my wounds started to heal<br><br>

But now I'm forgetting how your presence used to feel<br><br>

I chased your memories and locked them in cages<br><br>

In my diaries with their old yellowed pages<br><br>

I read our memories, the remnants of a past I left behind<br><br>

Each word laced with your presence makes me want to rewind<br><br>

To go back in time and ask you to stay<br><br>

So you and I could have just one more day<br><br>

I wish for one more day I could look into your eyes<br><br>

I wish for one more rain with you under the sky<br><br>

And I love you still each time the sky turns grey<br><br>

And I will love you always each time la vie en rose will play<br><br>

And as cliche and hopelessly romantic it sounds,<br><br>

I will love you till the last drop of rain touches the ground<br><br>

And some nights like this, I selfishly wish you stayed<br><br>

There are still feelings left to be felt and things left to be said<br><br>

I'm grateful though, that you stayed as long as you did<br><br>

You made me believe even two parallel lines can meet<br><br>

We were two parallel rays but our paths did cross<br><br>

And the memories with you make up for all that I've lost<br><br>

The smiles with you make up for all the tears I've shed<br><br>

I let you go with grace, with smiles, but I still wish you stayed<br><br>

Couldn't you stay,  just a little longer, maybe?<br><br>

After you, life ain't the same, but I'm fine, you see<br><br>

And each monsoon, I will walk on the streets under the rain<br><br>

Smiling with the memories of rains with you, wishing I could go back again<br><br>

There are so, so many things worth living for<br><br>

Yet here I live just to love you more<br><br>

But the shooting star was never meant for the star on the sky<br><br>

And i wonder if it's tears of that star everytime the sky cries<br><br>

And I still have one more thing left to say to you<br><br>

It was hard loving you, you know, but it was harder not to<br><br>

Thanks for this beautiful calligraphy <b>@saaaaraf_</b></span></p>

      <h5>Love Life <span class="w3-opacity">July 17,2020</span></h5>
        <p><b>richi.writes</b><br>
Dear future lover,<br>
Even though we have no idea about each other's existence now,<br>
Someday soon, we'll be in love with each other<br>
We'll do all the things people in love do<br>
And Once I'm in love again, I'm not letting you go<br>
But before that, here's something I want you to<span id="r">...</span><span id="s"> know<br><br>

Chances are, like Most love stories, ours too will start with a "replied to your story"<br>
But tell me your stories<br>
No, not the instagram ones that last for only 24 hours, Tell me stories of your life.<br>
I promise your snapchat dog filter is really cute<br>
But give me your school ID card version.<br>
You'll probably be making those cute playdate edits with my videos <br>
But know that I'll be waiting for "din shagna da" at our wedding <br>
I know a lifetime isn’t enough to know a person <br>
But we'll probably meet by swiping left On hundreds of uninteresting bios on tinder.<br>
I will be watching lots of your sky photographies on your Instagram stories<br>
But come, Let's watch the sky together.<br>
I want your thoughts to pop up in my head every second<br>
Your chat head can just chill.<br>
Let's not talk about those 1k+ facebook friends<br>
Let's talk about the friendships we've lost along the way.<br>
You might be storying your tired face with a time sticker of 2 am but let's talk about what keeps you awake all night.<br>
Enough of playing it cool by sharing depressed quotes and single memes<br>
Let's sit on the rooftop at 2 am and talk about that one heartbreak we can't get over<br><br>

Dear future love, <br>
Save that money instead of buying me expensive presents<br>
Your presence Will mean the world.<br>
Candlelight dinners in posh restaurants can wait<br>
Let's have dinner at my place in those steel plates with lentil and rice.<br>
We can always fight over the last slice of pizza<br>
But Let me snatch that one fuchka from your plate.<br>
Conversations over 800 tk crimson cup coffees can wait<br>
Let's have little chitchats in the balcony sipping our "extra milk" evening teas.<br><br>

Give me the typical 90s bollywood romance<br>
Give me the love that manages family finances<br>
Give me the love that chooses maggie over ramen<br>
Give me the effortless, fearless, unquenchable kind of love.<br>
Because my love, enough of scrolling, typing and swiping<br>
It's time we love looking into eyes instead of screens</span></p>

       <h3><b>Feminism</b></h3>
      <h5>Respect women <span class="w3-opacity">July 28,2020</span></h5>
        <p>
<b>richi.writes</b><br>
How many times have we hesitated to call ourseleves a feminist?<br>
It's okay, it's a difficult time for the society and females to coexist<br>
In a country where women are being "favoured" by being "allowed" to learn<br>
As if our right to survival and education were prizes we need to earn<br>
How many times do we get asked "are you those feminist type?"<br>
Feminism is not a trend we follow, it's actually<span id="x">...</span><span id="y"> different than you describe<br>
You'll be sitting in a roadside stall with your friends, sipping your tea<br>
While you state that a world without women would be a better place to be<br>
You don't want your girlfriend to wear a croptop but youll visit restricted sites at nights<br>
You'll share her private photos in group chats but won't have a share in the battles she fights<br>
You show us our place is in the kitchen to hold a spatula and a knife<br>
But you often seem to forget the knife that I hold might also take your life<br>
I am a woman, a mother,a daughter I'm all this and more<br>
I have the softest of hearts, I'm also a tigress that roars<br>
I define feminism by the women who decide to speak, feel and think<br>
Feminism is blue, black, red and every color and no, it doesn't resent pink<br>
Feminism is Malala Yousafzai who took a bullet in her head for female eduaction<br>
Feminism is the girl that refuses to marry wherever dowry is mentioned<br>
Feminism is Begum Rokeya for whom today I speak, feel and write<br>
Feminism believes my education is never my privilege but simply my right<br>
Feminism is a MAN questioning patriarchy and its crooked mentality<br>
Feminism is every human being who stands against injustice, who calls for equality<br>
Feminism is the girl with a zeal to learn but can't make it to school<br>
Because being a female is apparently against the "right to education" rules<br>
Feminism is every woman that cries when clothing is blamed for rape<br>
Feminism is the goddess you lower your head before, a woman you worship to find escape<br>
Feminism is a woman who smiles, screams, cries, falls but gets up too<br>
Feminism is us, feminism is me, feminism is you<br>
Enough of suppressing our voices and oppressing our feelings unspoken<br>
Women,it's time to choose the paths not chosen and to take the roads not taken<br><b>@artsymissy_</b> loveyoubebi❤</span></p>
