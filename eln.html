You say mothers don't need a separate day for appreciation<br>
You say every day is a mother's Day<br>
I say it's not.<br>
I say every day is anything but mother's Day<br><br>

Because everytime mom tells us to keep <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> the phone aside and sit together for dinner, we don't listen.<br>
We forget how in childhood we cried our hearts out to be fed by her.<br>
Everytime we're out with friends and mom keeps calling, we put the phone on silent.<br>
We forget how many times we used to call mom only to irritate her in work.
Everytime mom asks us to reply to a Facebook comment, we get irritated "Why can't you do this yourself?"<br>
We forget who held our fingers the first time we wrote ABCD<br><br>

No that's not all.<br><br>

There are single mothers struggling for survival fencing their children from the cruelty of the world.<br>
There are single fathers having no clue about how to raise children yet buying pads for their daughters and making them tea to help soothe the cramps.<br>
There are moms-to-be with medical complications, unsure if the child will even be born.<br>
Moms-to-be who aren't married, abandoned by the whole society.<br>
There are mothers who are handed over their stillborn child.<br>
There are mothers who have had a miscarriage.<br>
There are mothers who have been stars on the sky way too early.<br>
Mothers who just got to know they'll never be able to give birth.<br>
Mothers who adopted children to provide them with the warmth of a family.<br>
There are mothers who work and can't attend their children's important events.<br>
There are mothers who resign from jobs.<br>
There are mothers of every kind.<br>
And no, we do not celebrate mothers the way they deserve to be celebrated.<br><br>

It's okay we're a generation of shy kids<br>
Who'll probably never tell our mom how much warmth it gives us when we wake up shivering in cold at midnights and there are two hands putting a blanket on us.<br><br>

It's okay to have a day for mothers<br>
A day for every kind of mother out there.<br>
You don't have to be superheroes.<br>
God made you a mother. That's more than enough.<br>
