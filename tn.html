Happy International Women's Day<br>
Today I buy a pad and wrap it in a black polythene bag cause shhhhh, IT'S A SHAME!<br>
Happy International Women's Day<br>
I stop by a roadside stall to buy some chips<br>
I see two men sipping teas and<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> showing each other pictures of women saying "maal ta Dekh" (look at this item)<br>
Happy International Women's Day<br>
I walk on streets and there are lecherous eyes all around<br>
There are whistles and stares and hands waiting for a prey<br>
I lower my eyes to get home as soon as possible<br><br>
Happy International Women's Day.<br><br>

Today a girl will walk to school and get teased on streets<br>
Today a woman somewhere is getting raped<br>
Today a husband is beating up his wife to death<br>
Today a woman is set on fire because she wasn't capable of more dowries<br>
Today a girl at school is getting laughed at for her period stains<br>
Today a mother is shushing out a little girl who was complaining about how she doesn't like when a specific uncle touches her<br>
Today I will come across a Facebook group called "feminism is cancer"<br>
Today is The 8th of March.<br>
Today we say, Happy International Women's Day<br><br>

Happy International Women's Day<br>
To all the women around the universe<br>
To every female killed in womb<br>
To every woman trying to survive<br>
Happy International Women's Day<br>
To me<br>
To you<br>
To us<br></span></p>

       <h3><b>Art</b></h3>
      <h5>Happiness <span class="w3-opacity">March 25,2021</span></h5>
        <p><b>richi.writes</b><br>
Stop what you are doing. Tell me this. Why did you stop making art? When did you start thinking "life" is more important than art? Why do you now put less time into what you love and more into what makes you stressed and why do you go to sleep wondering if you wasted the day?<br><br>

Art. What is art, <span id="a">...</span><span id="b">after all? I would say art is what you dream of. Why did you stop dreaming? Was it because someone told you to make your art about "real" things or was it because someone told you your art was too complicated to understand? Is this why you now put less time into  painting, singing, dancing, writing or simply doing something you love? Did someone tell you "life" is more important than "art?"<br><br>

I'm sorry you heard that. I'm sorry the world stopped you right when your heart was full of excitement. Please don't stop believing in your art. I'll look at a painting of a street cat with equal amazement as how I'll look at an abstract painting I won't probably understand the meaning of. I'll read a whole 31 line poetry about post-breakup phase with equal interest as I'll put into an article about spaceships that I have no clue about. I'll listen to an original singer with equal feelings as I'll listen to the improvised version of a cover. If you're the artist and making art makes you happy, your art form to me is a whole universe waiting to be discovered. Your art is the whole world inside you. Your art is you. Your art will remind me of the sunflowers and will suffocate my lungs with joy and make me happy to be alive to witness this. Your art will make me fall in love. No matter how "complicated" or "unreal" your art form is, your art is the weight of all the things you carry with you the world never asked you about. Your art reminds me of happiness.<br><br>

Don't ever stop your art. Treat your art like your child. Love it like a mother. And if you're wondering if your art is real enough, as I said, art is dream. When were dreams real anyway? Happy artðŸ’–</span></p>
