      <h5>Beautiful people <span class="w3-opacity">August 13,2020</span></h5>
        <p><b>richi.writes</b><br>
Finally, I have fallen in love<br>
With this beautiful world and the beautiful people in it.<br>
When I think of happiness,<br>
I think of the genuine smile on the face of the rickshaw puller<br>
When I simply bid him a goodbye before <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">leaving.<br>
When I think of Hope,<br>
I think of the child who begs on roads, who hopes to be so successful that he can manage the expenses of his little sister’s education someday.<br>
When I think of Dreams,
I think of the little boy in the village, flying a paper plane and announcing he’ll be a pilot someday.<br>
I think of contentment
And I think of the smile of the little girl on the footpath who looks exactly as beautiful as the flowers she sells.<br>
When I think of care,<br>
I think of the man who buys some meat for the stray dogs on the streets.<br>
And I think of Love every single day.<br>
And love, lies all around.<br>
Love lies in the beggar lady on the overbridge I meet everyday and she smiles at me because one day, I gave her son a bottle of water.<br>
Love lies in the teenage boy who buys a blanket with all his saved pocket money to help the homeless child in winter.<br>
Love lies in the children learning to miss out on books, schools, cuddles, toys and learning to beg but never forgetting to smile.<br>
Love lies in this boy in our class who is polite, and made fun of, but never stops being nice to the people around him.<br>
Love lies in the doctors with little babies at home who are working during a PANDEMIC risking their life and missing out on cosy cuddles from their children, all to heal this world.<br>
Love lies in the friend, lending you a shoulder to cry on and who laughs with you over that stupid boy that broke your heart.<br>
Love lies in the teacher, never giving up on you, never getting tired to teach you because he UNDERSTANDS you don’t understand chemistry.<br>
This world, this beautiful world is filled with love<br>
And people during this cruel time, finding time to spread beauty<br>
Love is all around.<br>
It’s us who deny the beauty of this world and point fingers at its cruelty, at its unkindness, unfairness.<br>
We refuse to seek the love, that lies all around us.<br>
Maybe because it’s too near, that it’s difficult to see.</span></p>

       <h3><b>Daily Life</b></h3>
      <h5>Warm up <span class="w3-opacity">August 28,2020</span></h5>
        <p><b>richi.writes</b><br>
Today I woke up to the sound of rain and I cannot put into words enough how much that soothed me. Fresh raindrops on the flowers and leaves, fresh, cold morning air are things I'm usually deprived from because my lazy sleepy ass won't wake up before it's midnoon. So today as I sip my morning tea (completely forgetting about the class I had), I think of change. About how much I've changed throughout the years. And  <span id="a">...</span><span id="b">surprisingly, I realize, I've changed SO MUCH and what's even more surprising is so did all the people I know.<br><br>

If a year ago you told me I've changed, I'd immediately get butthurt and say "NO I haven't" but probably not now. Because, I HAVE changed and whereas some slight changes can easily go unnoticed, there are HUGE changes in 2020 Richita. Even I sometimes wonder, wow, so this is how I think now? No, I haven't turned into a complete stranger, comeon I'm only 17, but the changes are obvious.<br><br>

Change is inevitable and I'm changing EVERY day. Each day, I'm growing up. This whole process of growing up, no matter how exhausting it is, is also exciting. And that too, because of the changes. We're all changing and that's the unavoidable truth. We're changing in the way we think, talk, behave, feel and how we percieve this world. Changes come with age, with experiences. I might not make the same choice in a similar situation today as I did 2 years ago. THAT's change. And THAT, my friend, is liberating. We're learning, scarring, running, worrying, falling down, getting up, LIVING. And in the process, we're changing. We're all ensuring we won't repeat those same mistakes, won't give our time to toxic people, won't beg for anything and what not. And truth be told, it's not always possible. We're still making mistakes, struggling to set boundaries, making bad choices, we're still afraid of change. We all are.</span></p>

      <h5>Relief <span class="w3-opacity">September 12,2020</span></h5>
        <p><b>richi.writes</b><br>
So I've finally met my friends after what felt like an eternity<br>
The air hit different when I finally stepped out in this sick, sad city<br>
I finally met my friends just when I started to forget how their hugs used to feel<br>
My friend, love saves lives while there's a virus out there to kill<br>
When we ran up to each other, the air smelt like happiness and daisies<br>
We all felt the warmth even when gloves hid our hands and masks covered faces<br>
The same hands I used to sleep on need to get "sanitized" before they <span id="r">...</span><span id="s">touch me<br>
And even though masks hid those precious smiles, in our eyes love is all you'd see<br>
There's a virus in the air, claiming thousands of lives and making millions sick<br>
In this difficult, sad, cruel time, my friends and their warmth is all I could seek<br>
Locked up in the same four walls for five months finally hit really hard<br>
To know I can't hug them tight, touch them or even feed them hurt my heart.<br>
And soon it was finally time to go<br>
Not hugging my friends is a feeling my heart doesn't know<br>
These faces, these laughters, this genuine happiness is all I wished for<br>
After yesterday, it all feels so sad but I couldn't thank God more.<br>
The day had to end and we had to bid goodbyes<br>
But at the end, there is something I do realize<br>
Stay home for you and yours and I'll stay home for me and mine<br>
Because after this ends, I want us all to be surviving just fine<br>
A hug, a simple touch is now too big of a deal<br>
But as I said, love saves lives while a virus is on a mission to kill<br>
I know I haven't met all my precious friends and my heart cries for that<br>
But I know someday we'll meet again and hug and happiness will scare away the sad<br>
The world is so sick now and I pray soon it heals<br>
Distance from my people is a feeling I never want to feel<br>
Distance and friends should never again be two words in the same line<br>
So stay home for you and yours and I'll stay home for me and mine.<br>
The world will heal someday and we'll remember how it felt<br>
We'll remember these struggles, these feelings and how strongly we've dealt.<br>
So touch. And love. As long as you can still do so<br>
Cause the time is cruel, my friend, it'll be over before you know.<br><br>

Added something sweet in the picture ;) </span></p>

      <h5>Huge Respect <span class="w3-opacity">September 12,2020</span></h5>
        <p>
<b>richi.writes</b><br>
Dear doctors of Covid-19, here I write an open letter to you<br>
To let you know we're proud and grateful for every single thing you do<br>
Thank you. For risking your life only to save ours<br>
For your constant struggles days after days and hours after hours<br>
Thank you. In this cruel world, you decided to be kind<br>
Thank you. For standing as a shield to save the mankind.<br>
We know you have little kids who're waiting for<span id="x">...</span><span id="y"> you at home<br>
But you manage to smile at an ailing patient to provide them with hope<br>
You wear those PPEs and all and we know they give you scars<br>
We hope these scars remind you of how strongly you fought these wars<br>
We are sorry you have to fight everyday, sorry for all these struggles<br>
We're sorry you have to stay far from people you love and miss out on cuddles<br>
Heroes for us were main characters in movies, men fighting with a gun<br>
Only today do we realize heroes are you, the light in the dark, just like the sun.<br>
And we're proud. For you have decided to fight<br>
We're grateful. For your constant service day and night<br>
And I know someday soon this world will heal<br>
And I hope you know well how proud we do feel<br>
And we're thankful for you still hold it in you<br>
To stay strong and fight knowing what the virus can do<br>
The virus has to bow down for you're standing with love and care<br>
Evil will die because love is what it fears.<br>
You carry your scars so our generation can know<br>
Exactly how to be when we grow<br>
Risking your life for the world, we don't know how much it's taking<br>
But once we heal, I hope we remember with pride the sacrifices you're making<br>
And for those who've lost their lives, our hearts will always ache for you<br>
The world will take your name with pride for it's rare to be born as a hero as you.<br>
Sincerely,
The world.
