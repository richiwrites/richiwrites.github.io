        <h3><b>Mental Health</b></h3>
      <h5>Health <span class="w3-opacity">May 29,2020</span></h5>
        <p><b>richi.writes</b>
It's now more important than ever to talk about mental health considering the testing phase we all are going through. I talked to my mom who works with mental health and learnt a lot. It's great that so many people worldwide are talking about mental health, normalising mental illness and sharing their experiences. But we still have a long way to go because even now seeking clinical help due to mental health issues is avoided as much as <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> possible. People often think mental health issues depend on mood or "it's all in our head" and it will go away if we decide to ignore it. That's mostly because mental health problems are not easily understandable unlike our physical illnesses.<br><br>

But ignoring any disease is NOT the cure to it. It impacts our thoughts, emotions, beliefs, our whole inner state. Mental health is just as important as physical health, if not more. It's unhealthy and risky to live with the unimaginable sense of emptiness a brain can feel. Our brain is a vital organ of our body and it also deserves proper treatment just like the other organs. Suffering from mental health issues is not a matter to be hidden, not something to be ashamed of. It's completely okay to eliminate the intangible stress that affects our healthy lifestyle. It DOES NOT go away if we push it, we do not just "forget it", it is mundane and it exists. It needs to be addressed and treated.<br><br>
We need to trust the process of healing and we're not going to let it slide. Chronic depression, acute anxiety, all these are medical terms and there are professionals to help us get through this. So we don't just "brush it off". We grow and outgrow, we FOCUS on our mental health, we assess and reassess our problems, we take help and we get better. We steer towards healing before it leads to other hydra headed problems. There are people who have suffered, reached out for help and have overcome this phase. I would tell all of you to open up and inspire the others going through similar problems. Let's talk about it, share our experiences and seek help if required. These are NOT the stories of our "problems" or weakness, these are only our STORIES OF STRENGTH.</span></p>

      <h5>Equality <span class="w3-opacity">June 3,2020</span></h5>
        <p><b>richi.writes</b>
After yet another brutal death of a black man, there has erupted a global protest. Today, we call for a revolution. Today we ask for the privileged voices to be muted for the muted minority voices to be heard. And the movement in America is not an indication for a war, the objective is to stop the racism war going on for decades for once and for all.<br><span id="a">...</span><span id="b">
I can put million reasonings as to why racism should stop. But the enormity of racism has been a part of the vast history of colonial subjugation and oppression. History shows harrowing deaths of innocent black people, the rate of black death by police is higher than any other minority group. Enough of trying to change people's views and treatment through thoughtful insights. Now it's time to WORK and take ACTIONS to actually contribute to the uprising. Because black people face injustice in every sphere of their life every single day. We are only voicing our opinions when their deaths unfold in front of our eyes, it's only now we are aware how brutal the situation in reality is.<br><br>
Racism is deep rooted. We need to speak up and act against it wherever we encounter the smallest act of race deprivation. THAT is the motive of the movement. It all starts with us. So what we need to do is PAUSE. We do our part. We EDUCATE. REFLECT. READ. LEARN. LISTEN. Donate and sign petitions. Listen to what the black activists are portraying in their anti racist movements. This is for Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, George Floyd, for Black liberation. For black culture, black music, black lives. Because BLACK LIVES MATTER.<br><br>
White privilege exists. Racism exists. Black mothers have felt the death of George Floyd in their motherhood and Black people have now been pushed to a point to risk it all to scream for justice, to call for a revolution.<br><br>
Let's involve with organizations to donate, sign petitions and do everything in our power to help George Floyd recieve justice for I'm sure he is looking forward to a change in this world from up above.<br><br>

Let's work so we never have to see another human being strangled to death on streets, gasping for breath and begging to survive.</span></p>

I hope i can teach my kids to be humane and kind<br><br>

I hope they carry kindness and love deep inside their mind<br><br>

I hope my kids can change the world with the beauty they<span id="r">...</span><span id="s"> see<br><br>

Their hearts should be big enough for the whole world to fit<br><br>

Soft enough to cry and hurt for even the animals on streets<br><br>

I hope my kids can know the history of it all<br><br>

How the world can rise and how the world falls<br><br>

How humanity fails humans sometimes<br><br>

I hope their hearts are strong enough to fight these crimes<br><br>

I hope they're not afraid to take their swords out of their sheaths<br><br>

I hope they know about George Floyd and make this world a safer place to breathe<br><br>

I hope they know about the history of innocent animals being killed<br><br>

A world full of smiles, beauty and love - I hope they can build<br><br>

I hope they scream for justice and have minds awakened<br><br>

I hope they have hearts soft as flowers to feel for the broken<br><br>

I hope as a mother I teach my kids all that I know<br><br>

How they should use their griefs as an inspiration to grow<br><br>

I have failed too and I hope I tell them this<br><br>

Despite the griefs and aches, life to me was a bliss<br><br>

I hope my kids find it in them to correct their wrongs<br><br>

I hope my kids remember in grief how to stay strong<br><br>

I hope they are weak enough to cry when others do<br><br>

I hope they cry with them and fight for them too<br><br>

I hope my kids know momma wasn't silent during the history she had seen<br><br>

I hope they hold in their hearts to be stronger than momma had ever been<br><br>

I hope my kids know momma failed some battles she had fought<br><br>

I hope my kids remember with pride whatever momma had taught</span></p>

       <h3><b>Superwomen</b></h3>
      <h5>Womenpower <span class="w3-opacity">June 8,2020</span></h5>
        <p>
<b>richi.writes</b><br>
I browse the internet and i come across an article that reads<br><br>

A woman turns into a superwoman on the seven days she bleeds<br><br>

Menstruation is not an achievement, our body<span id="x">...</span><span id="y"> is constructed this way<br><br>

But what makes us superwomen is the unbearable cramps on a period day<br><br>

On the days my legs refuse to walk and my hips feel like being ripped off<br><br>

You can never really tell because you've never watched me stop<br><br>

I don't stop because I still manage to run to catch my bus so I don't run late<br><br>

We, as women, have accepted the pain of period considering this as our fate<br><br>

You might now say, "com'on girl stop whining it's not that big of a deal<br><br>

We've tweeted and posted on social media we all know the drill"<br><br>

Yes you know about period but do you know about dysmenorrhea, a disease?<br><br>

It's the medical term of menstrual cramps caused due to the uterine squeeze<br><br>

Oligomennorhea, referring to missed menstruation for more than 35 days<br><br>

These can lead to severe gynocologic disorders, if not addressed, as research says<br><br>

So it's not something that women born before you have suffered now you must too<br><br>

It might be a disease that needs to be cured, don't just silently "go through"<br><br>

As estrogen secreting humans, we face a whole week we flow a red sea<br><br>

Stuck inside a heavy cotton pad, the female organ wishes there was a better place to be<br><br>

Our medicines wrapped in transparent polythenes but pads, in a black one to hide<br><br>

We, the "superwomen", have still not learnt how to bleed with pride "Whisper", "freedom", "stayfree" all bought for our red stains to be invisibilized<br><br>

Women in remote villages, still using clothes, where menstruation is still not normalized<br><br>

Dear men, please talk about period to your daughter and your wife<br><br>

Because an ignorance might even risk their life<br><br>

You see me calm, quiet and focused, working at my desk<br><br>

You cannot really tell my cramps are killing me, even surviving feels like a test<br><br>

Despite the pain and sufferings, I'm proud of the blood I flow<br><br>

Because I fight wars with my body so that in my womb, a new human can grow<br><br>

Flowing a red ocean every month with this pain, it's not easy, you see<br><br>

But if God gives me the power, a woman is all I'll ever want to be.</span></p>
